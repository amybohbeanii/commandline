To see the tasks that we completed during this sprint, along with evidence of completion, see the cards and card comments in the “Done” list on our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/jNHxdxiL/softsyspeskypintos) or see the list below:

[Research VM Theory and bring in notes on topics in VM](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o5RZs28DHMHPYEKhko-TQksUKRmZS9w19s89c3lyUyw/edit).

[Get together to set up development environment. Get Pintos and Arduino working](https://github.com/bishiguro/SoftSysPeskyPintos/blob/master/configure_pintos.sh).

[Choose either Pintos or Arduino. Have a meeting to make a pros/cons on both paths. We chose Pintos](https://trello.com/c/I4mBAkmO/7-determine-which-hardware-libraries-or-existing-projects-to-use-have-a-meeting-and-make-pro-con-bullet-points-1-to-1-5-hr).

[Get together to draw a block diagram of VM to understand how VM works. Understand TLB, Page Tables, Address Translation](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B6n1zsVOIMe6VXNFM280UnhmVDg).

[Ask Ben during class time to confirm/review our block diagram to see if we need to make additional changes in our current understanding of VM](We talked to Ben and we concluded that we want to expand our replacement procedure when we get there in implementation).

Re-evaluate project MVP and stretch goals. Our team’s learning goal for this project is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the theory and implementation of virtual memory.

[Work through Projects 1 and 2 in Pintos in order to start VM implementation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pPJVoXkzB9vAcKZOBHPdK81diZmTF2zh0bMJQ_gvWGM/edit).

[Setup script to get Pintos running](https://github.com/bishiguro/SoftSysPeskyPintos/blob/master/configure_pintos.sh).
