Present a product backlog for the next sprint that represents a concrete plan that will keep the entire team productively engaged and get you to your stated goals (this can be a link to your Trello board). If you had trouble putting together evidence for your cards in the previous sprints, adjust your new cards accordingly.

Research VM specific implementation strategies: 1 page of notes each

Debug threading in Pintos exercise 1 or understand solution

Deliverable: notes on what is occurring in exercise 1 and what issues we ran into, demo of working code

Understand Pintos User Programs exercise 2

Deliverable: notes on what is happening in exercise 2, and any issues we run into if we attempt to implement it, demo of working code


Implement:
* Pintos Virtual memory project
* Pages
* Stack growth
* Page tables / Address mapping
* User memory during system calls
* Error handling for page faults

To see the tasks that we completed during this sprint, along with evidence of completion, see the cards and card comments in the “Done” list on our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/jNHxdxiL/softsyspeskypintos) or see the list below:

[Research VM Theory and bring in notes on topics in VM](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o5RZs28DHMHPYEKhko-TQksUKRmZS9w19s89c3lyUyw/edit).

[Get together to set up development environment. Get Pintos and Arduino working](https://github.com/bishiguro/SoftSysPeskyPintos/blob/master/configure_pintos.sh).

[Choose either Pintos or Arduino. Have a meeting to make a pros/cons on both paths. We chose Pintos](https://trello.com/c/I4mBAkmO/7-determine-which-hardware-libraries-or-existing-projects-to-use-have-a-meeting-and-make-pro-con-bullet-points-1-to-1-5-hr).

[Get together to draw a block diagram of VM to understand how VM works. Understand TLB, Page Tables, Address Translation](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B6n1zsVOIMe6VXNFM280UnhmVDg).

[Ask Ben during class time to confirm/review our block diagram to see if we need to make additional changes in our current understanding of VM](We talked to Ben and we concluded that we want to expand our replacement procedure when we get there in implementation).

Re-evaluate project MVP and stretch goals. Our team’s learning goal for this project is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the theory and implementation of virtual memory.

[Work through Projects 1 and 2 in Pintos in order to start VM implementation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pPJVoXkzB9vAcKZOBHPdK81diZmTF2zh0bMJQ_gvWGM/edit).

[Setup script to get Pintos running](https://github.com/bishiguro/SoftSysPeskyPintos/blob/master/configure_pintos.sh).
